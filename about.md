title: About Me

Hi there! I am Zhi Yuan and welcome to my blog!

The Internet has a vast amount of resources and information on it, but very often it is hard to find what you're looking for. I enjoy writing technical articles that cannot be found on other websites and simplifying complicated technical concepts as they have helped me and my peers, and hopefully you too.

On this blog, I document my learnings on Blazor & Azure Static Web Apps - the tech stack that I am using for a side project that I am working on with my girlfriend.

Hope my blog is of use to you!
